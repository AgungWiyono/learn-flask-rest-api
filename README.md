# Learn REST API in Python

Create REST API with Flask-RESTful (and flask-marshmallow)

## Detail

This scripts for api.py is based on tutorial posted by Miguel Grinberg on his blog.

But since the Flask-RESTful reqparse module is not recommended anymore by Flask-RESTful doc, I'm trying to find another alternatives, by using flask-marshmallow.
